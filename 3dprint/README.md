# 3D Printed Resources

Welcome to the collection of 3D printed resources submitted by our community! If you have a 3D printed resource you'd like to share, please submit a pull request following the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Using 3D Printed Resource Files

If you own a 3D printer, you can use these resource files to print your own keyboard parts. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can still utilize these files by sending them to a 3D printing service. Keep in mind that some services may charge a fee for printing and shipping the parts to you.

Most of the resource files are in the STL format, which is a commonly used 3D printing format. To use them with a 3D printing service, simply upload the STL files and place an order for the parts to be printed.

If you have any questions about an individual resource, feel free to contact the person who submitted it or join the [Latamkeys Discord Server](https://discord.gg/latamkeys) and ask in the `#3d-diy-handwire` channel.

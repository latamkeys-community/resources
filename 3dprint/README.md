## How to use 3D Print resources files?

If you have a 3D printer, you can use the 3D printed resources files to print your own keyboard parts. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can use the 3D printed resources files to send to a 3D printing service. Keep in mind that 3D printing services may charge you for printing the parts and shipping the parts to you.

Most of the 3D printed resources files are in the STL format, which is the most common 3D printing format. If you are using a 3D printing service, you can upload the STL files to the service and order the parts to be printed. 

If you have any questions about an individual 3D printed resource, please contact the person who submitted the resource or join the [Latamkeys Discord Server](https://discord.gg/latamkeys) and ask in the `#3d-diy-handwire` channel.

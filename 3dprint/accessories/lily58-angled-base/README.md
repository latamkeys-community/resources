# Lily58 Angled Base

Simple base for the [Lily58 keyboard](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58).

The STL file provided was created with the following parameters, which can be changed in the source .scad to customize it:

```
clearance = 0.2;
typing_angle = 7;
base_thickness = 0.9;
feet_height = 1;
feet_diameter = 12;
feet_exposure = 0.4;
leg_outer_wall_width = 0.8;
```

To print both sides mirror the model in the slicer.

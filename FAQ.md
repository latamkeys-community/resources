# Frequently Asked Questions

This section aims to answer commonly asked questions about the mechanical keyboard project and hobby.

### What is a mechanical keyboard?

A mechanical keyboard is a type of keyboard that uses mechanical switches to register key presses. These keyboards tend to be louder and more tactile than their membrane counterparts, and they are generally more durable as well. Additionally, mechanical keyboards can be customized with different keycaps.

### What is a custom mechanical keyboard?

A custom mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that is built and customized by the user. This can include selecting the mechanical switches and keycaps, as well as designing and using a PCB (printed circuit board) that connects the switches to the computer. Custom PCBs can be designed by the user or by members of the community using software such as KiCad or EasyEDA.

### What is a switch?

A switch is a mechanical component that is used to register key presses on a keyboard. It typically consists of a spring, stem, and contact, and is activated by pressing down on the stem. When the stem is pressed, the contact is closed and the switch is activated. Some switches can also be activated by pressing and releasing the stem.

### What is a keycap?

A keycap is a plastic or metal cover that is placed on top of a switch on a keyboard. Keycaps can be made of plastic or metal, and they can be designed to fit a specific switch or a universal fit. Keycaps can be designed using 3D modeling software such as Blender or Fusion 360.

### What is a keycap set?

A keycap set is a collection of keycaps that are designed to fit a specific keyboard. Like individual keycaps, keycap sets can be made to fit a specific keyboard or a universal fit, and they can be designed using 3D modeling software such as Blender or Fusion 360.

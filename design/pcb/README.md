### PCB Design FAQs

#### What is a keyboard PCB?

A PCB, or printed circuit board, is the main component of a keyboard. It contains the microcontroller, diodes, switches, and LEDs that control the behavior and functionality of the keyboard.

#### What is a hotswap PCB?

A hotswap PCB is a type of PCB that allows users to easily swap out switches without the need for soldering. These PCBs are commonly used in custom keyboards and tend to be more expensive than soldered PCBs due to the additional components they contain.

#### What is a soldered PCB?

A soldered PCB is a type of PCB that requires soldering in order to install switches. These PCBs are often used in pre-built keyboards and tend to be more cost-effective due to the fewer components they contain. Soldered PCBs are also generally more reliable and easier to repair compared to hotswap PCBs.

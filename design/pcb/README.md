### FAQ about PCB design

#### What is a keyboard PCB?

A PCB is a printed circuit board. It is a board that contains the electronic components of a keyboard. The PCB is the main component of a keyboard. It contains the microcontroller, the diodes, the switches, and the LEDs. The PCB is the part of the keyboard that is responsible for the behavior of the keyboard.

#### What is a Hotswap PCB?

A hotswap PCB is a PCB that allows you to swap switches without soldering. Hotswap PCBs are usually used in custom keyboards and are usually more expensive than soldered PCBs because they contain more components.

#### What is a soldered PCB?

A soldered PCB is a PCB that requires soldering to install switches. Soldered PCBs are usually used in pre-built keyboards and are usually cheaper. Soldered PCBs are usually more reliable than hotswap PCBs because they contain fewer components and are less likely to fail, they are also easier to repair.

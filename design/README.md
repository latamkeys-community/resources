## What files are considered design resources?

Design resources are files that are used to design a keyboard or a keyboard part. These files can be used to create a keyboard using a 3D printer, CNC machine, or other manufacturing method. Accesories are also considered design resources, such as bases for keycaps, artisan cases and others.

## General guidelines

Try to keep files as organized as possible. Use the correct categories and subcategories. If you are not sure where to put a file, please ask in the [Latamkeys Discord Server](https://discord.gg/latamkeys) in the `#3d-diy-handwire` or `#sistemas` channel.

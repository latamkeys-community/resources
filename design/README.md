This repository is a collection of design resources submitted by members of the community. If you have a design resource you would like to share, please submit a pull request following the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What types of files are considered design resources?

Design resources are files that can be used to design a keyboard or keyboard accessory. These files can be used to create a keyboard using a 3D printer, CNC machine, or other manufacturing method. Examples of design resources include files for creating keyboard bases, artisan keycaps cases, and other accessories.

## General Guidelines

To ensure the clarity and organization of the design resources, we ask that you try to keep files as organized as possible. Use the appropriate categories and subcategories for your files, and if you are unsure where to place a file, feel free to ask in the [Latamkeys Discord Server](https://discord.gg/latamkeys) in the `#3d-diy-handwire` or `#sistemas` channels.

## Naming Conventions for Resources

Here are some guidelines for naming resources:

#### File Names

File names should be in lowercase and use underscores to separate words.

#### Image Files

Images should be uploaded to image hosting services such as Imgur, and the link to the image should be used in the markdown file instead of uploading the image directly to the repository.

#### QMK Keymaps

If the resource is a QMK keymap, please use the following naming convention:

```text
<keyboard>-<layout>-<username>.json
```

If your username contains hyphens, please replace them with underscores. Try to use the same username that you use in the QMK configurator.

Example: `planck-rev6-myth.json`
